# Basket Analyzer

Welcome to the **Basket Analyzer** project! This repository contains the code for a sophisticated e-commerce analysis tool that combines advanced machine learning techniques to gain insights from synthetic shopping data.

## Project Overview

**Basket Analyzer** demonstrates essential data science concepts and their applications, including:

- **Data Generation and Preprocessing**: Create and manipulate synthetic e-commerce data using Pandas and Numpy.
- **Association Rule Learning with Apriori Algorithm**: Discover hidden patterns and associations between products.
- **Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering**: Segment customers based on their shopping habits for targeted marketing.
- **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA**: Reduce data complexity while retaining key characteristics for visualization.
- **Interactive 3D Visualizations**: Use Plotly to create engaging visualizations of analysis results.

## Key Components

- **Data Generation**: Synthetic dataset creation and preprocessing.
- **Apriori Algorithm**: Mining association rules to uncover product relationships.
- **K-means Clustering**: Segmenting customers based on purchasing patterns.
- **PCA**: Reducing dimensionality for improved data visualization.
- **Plotly Visualizations**: 3D visualizations of analysis results.

## Real-World Applications

- **Product Recommendations**: Suggest frequently bought together items to boost sales.
- **Store Layout Optimization**: Enhance product placement based on purchasing patterns.
- **Targeted Marketing**: Develop personalized marketing campaigns for different customer segments.
- **Inventory Management**: Optimize stock levels based on product associations.
- **Customer Experience Enhancement**: Tailor the shopping experience to various customer groups.
